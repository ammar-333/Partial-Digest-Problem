## Partial-Digest-Problem

this is a simple python code for the known Partial-Digest-Problem using two brute force algorithm and thisA quick summary of it<br/>

The sample of DNA is exposed to the restriction enzyme for only a limited amount of time to prevent it from being cut at all restriction sites.
This experiment generates the set of all possible restriction fragments between every two (not necessarily consecutive) restriction sites.
This set of fragment sizes is used to determine the positions of the restriction sites in the DNA sequence.

X: the set of n integers representing the location of all cuts in the restriction map, including the start and end

n: the total number of cuts

L: the multiset of integers represents len of each of the fragment 

Goal: Given all pairwise distances between points on a line, reconstruct the positions of those points.

Input: The multiset of pairwise distances L, containing n(n-1)/2 integers.

Output: A set X, of n integers.
